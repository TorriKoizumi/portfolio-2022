                        <p>I completed this project during my internship with Pono Design Studio. The thank you cards were for Grow It Yourself Chicago, a small business that provides easy to use gardening kits for those trying to start a home garden. <br>

                        Pono had previously created the brand guidelines. I was tasked with creating three variations of card designs that would be sent to the customers along with the grow kits. Their only request was to have a simple variation. <br>
                        
                        I started by playing with the typeface, looking for the right wording and rearranging the words until they lost all meaning to me. Pono had already set up the style guide for the brand, so I followed the rules but interpreted them in my own way. I created two simple options, one with just type, and the other featuring their rooster Carl. For the last variation, I wanted it to be worthy of the fridge. So I made a fun composition of something that I thought could hang around after receiving. <br>
                        
                        In the end, GIY decided to go with the simple thank you card.</p>
